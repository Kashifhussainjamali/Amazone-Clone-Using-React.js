# Description

This project is a dynamic clone of Amazon built using ReactJS. Users can browse products, 
add them to the cart, and see real-time updates to the cart total. Upon clicking "Buy," the total
price is reflected in the bill. The project demonstrates state management, dynamic rendering, 
and a smooth user experience similar to real-world e-commerce platforms.
